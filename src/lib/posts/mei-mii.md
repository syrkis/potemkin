Mei Mii's Relics of Burden appears to be an ode to her archival background, but only in part. Close inspection of the horse saddles displayed reveals that Mii, while maintaining the aesthetics of archiving, neglects its most crucial aspect: the preservation of the archived. All that remains of the original saddles is their distinctly equestrian look.

It is thus tempting to view Mii's work as being in the tradition of asemics like Luigi Serafini, and indeed the notion of removing meaning on all but the superficial levels is a theme in Relics of Burden. However, below the equestrian look is not a meaningless alphabet of form and craft, but rather a distinct sense of disfigurement and deformity, from certain angels revealing mask-like expressions. Posing the question "What creatures could wear such things?" while beholding Mii's work provokes as disquieting a mental image as any.

The saddles, once featured in their original form amidst the grand battle scenes of Akira Kurosawa's 1985 epic Ran, hold familial ties for Mii as Kurosawa's maternal niece. Of the more than 200 saddles employed in the film, only half are accounted for, with 20 repurposed for Relics of Burden and the remainder archived by the Kurosawa family estate under Miiâ€™s management.
