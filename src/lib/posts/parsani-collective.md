Parsani collective consists of a multiplicitous rhizome of artists, restoration workers, historians, archaeologists, designers and engineers working with, and through middle eastern diasporic narratives. In this exhibition, four years in the making, Parsani collective performs a series of elisions between scopes and scales of lived and material history.

In 2019, Parsani collective set up BAYT as a womenâ€™s shelter, exhibition space, and locus of activism. Here students from fashion academies across Europe were invited for a series of residencies where they worked together with displaced women. Working under the auspices of the Parsani collective, this became a site of exchange of knowledge and of reciprocal learning between the students and the residents of the home.

The collective sourced rugs, often in fragments or states of disrepair.  Advanced scanning and topological analysis techniques were employed to generate 3d animated tutorial videos of the exact spatial operations required to assemble the carpet, experimenting with different approaches, the attendants managed to perform the operations of creation in reverse, disentangling, atomizing the carpet into its most basic unit - the thread. The threads are then categorized according to age, colour and site of manufacture. Building up this massive carthoteque of threads from across western asia, the collective uses various procedural and generative digital tools in a speculative imagework creating new textile vernaculars by breeding together motifs from different carpets. Threads extricated from different carpets, but manufactured and dyed at the same centers of textile production were then recombined in new works - positing a kind quantum entanglement enacted along lines of exchange.

This insistence on the meaning carrying potential of the individual thread - as ganglia of memory, stands as clear analogy for a humanist position. 

What then becomes of this gesture of disentangling the monadic threads that together corporate a whole, that effects an integrated ground for imagemaking along complex spatial operations? 

What paralleities and disjunctions arise between the movements, the (dis)en-tanglings of persons, peoples, materials and objects?
