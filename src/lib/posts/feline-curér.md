For the institute’s inaugural exhibition,
Feline Curér has created an extensive floor
installation that spans the entire first and second floors of the galleries.
Working with biomimicry, procedural
generation techniques and cutting edge manufacturing processes, Curér has littered the galleries with thousands of clay, porcelain and polymer pieces of variable shape and size.
Walking through the galleries, there’s something unnerving about being surrounded by such ceaseless variation of form. It feels as if one is moving amongst the discarded scraps of a creation-work, and it is among this refuse that Curér performs her flourish; a sort of fanning out of materialities.

And herein resides a central disaffectation, Curér’s work seems aesthetically disenchanted. There’s a kind of indolence here– in creating work of such material magnitude and impermanence.

A bored god: “Here are all possible forms laid out before me, and so what?” Further exacerbated by the apparent joylessness of these artifacts, their muted colors, their shapelessness only verging towards any kind of specificity.
Perhaps this attitude in itself is analogous to the carelessness with which nature churns out sentient beings. The gesture of producing such resource intensive artworks in a time of global material crises is fraught. Her work neither presents as a celebration of natural exuberance, nor is there much eco-activism to be traced here.

Void of any such overt ideological or social engagement the exhibition space eventuates as a null field.
We wander among the cast off vestiges of a cosmogony, or perhaps an eschatology - a world that has run its course.
It is in this somber state, between unity and separation, chaos and order, growth and decay, that the exhibition’s genius operates; a fecund liminal zone where the boundaries between synthetic and natural blur, it is in this soft vacillatory spasm that Curér arrays before our very eyes the sheer plenitude of potential form.
