The centerpiece of Mei Saito's latest exhibition is a mesh of horse saddles. At first glance, the saddles appear uniform, but upon closer inspection each one has slight variations in size, shape, and texture. In fact Saito has partially transformed the saddels more enigmatic leather objects, keeping the texture of usefullness, though inspection will reveal that they in fact have none. They are rather tools of a dream world.

Saito meticulously sourced the saddles from antiques markets and saddle makers across Europe and North America as well as the archives of her late uncle, acclaimed director Akira Kurosawa. Several of the saddles were originally used in the production of Kurosawa's 1954 classic film Seven Samurai.

By repurposing these cinematic relics into a minimalist artwork, Saito creates a conceptual and material link between film history and contemporary art. In preparing the exhibition, Saito collaborated closely with her partner, fellow artist Feline Curér, whose keen eye helped shape the final installation. By presenting the saddles vertically as if on a hidden rack, Saito and Curér create an immersive experience that encourages close examination of each weathered saddle.

The worse saddles, transformed from functional props into artistic readymades, speak to ideas of ephemerality, craftsmanship and the passage of time. Their muted tones connect to histories of animal labor, transport and Kurosawa's iconic samurai films. In the accompanying text, Saito explains her fascination with these artifacts of a celluloid past, writing "The saddle relics bear traces of their use in cinematic history while also revealing their deeper material origins. Devoid of horse or rider, they hover in a liminal space between artifact and art object."

Through meticulous collection and thoughtful installation, Saito, with Curér's assistance, reimagines the residual evidence of a utilitarian past within a new conceptual framework. The worse saddles become conduits for exploring issues of deterioration, preservation and the continuing influence of Japanese film history.
