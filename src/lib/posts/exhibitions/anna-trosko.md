For the museum’s inaugural exhibition, and her first institutional solo, Feline Curér has created an extensive floor installation work that spans the entire first and second floors of the museum. Using procedural generation techniques and cutting edge manufacturing processes, Curér has littered the galleries with thousands of clay, porcelain and polymer pieces of variable shape and size. 


There’s something almost unnerving about being surrounded by such ceaseless variation of form. The pieces are vaguely serpentine in morphology, and it is through this biomimicry that Curér performs her flourish; a fanning out of materiality itself. It is as if we are walking among the discarded scraps of a creation-work, among this refuse; all the forms in between, all the things that could have been. 


And herein a central disaffectation, Curér’s work seems aesthetically disenchanted somehow - a bored god; “here are all possible forms laid out before me, and so what?”. There's a kind of desultory indolence here, creating work of such material magnitude and impermanence. This is exacerbated by the apparent joylessness of these artifacts, their muted colors, their shapelessness, only verging towards any kind of specificity. Perhaps this attitude in itself is analogous to the carelessness with which nature churns out sentient beings, the gesture of producing such resource intensive artworks in a time of global material crises is definitely not a colorful celebration of nature’s vitality, nor is there much eco-activism here. Void of any such overt ideological or social entanglements the exhibition space is transformed into a null field. We wander among the cast off vestigials of a cosmogony, or an eschatology - a world that has run its course. It is in this somber state, between unity and separation, chaos and order, growth and decay, that the exhibition's genius operates; a fecund liminal zone where the boundaries between the synthetic and the natural become blurred, and in this soft vacillatory spasm, Curér arrays before our very eyes the sheer plenitude of potential form - the raw matter of creation.
