Ivers Finner (b.1982) is an Estonia based artist, writer, game developer, archaeologist and museologist. 

His practice, which spans multiple fields of interest, revolves largely around investigating man-made objects, particularly stone sculpture. In 2013 he and his research collective Fimir began laying the groundwork for what would later become the IAMD, the International Artefact Museum Database.

Collating data, standardizing archival systems, and creating thorough and high quality 3d scans of thousands of artifacts, they have created the worldâ€™s most extensive publicly searchable database of archaeological objects - spanning from prehistory until the year 1000 CE. The IAMD serves not only to contribute to the preservation and study of cultural heritage but also open up avenues for artistic research across different civilizations and time periods. 


With the assistance of Virian Project, a scandinavia based artificial intelligence consultancy firm, Finner has created a generative adversarial network trained on the vast trove of 3d models in the IAMD. Using this GAN (named Gibil after the sumerian patron god of metalworkers) Finner plays at a synthesis of material cultures, merging together temporally and geologically disparate object vernaculars. A single object might have traits of bronze age celtic cairns, neo-assyrian palace reliefs, archaic aegean sculpture. The models are then used to carve the final sculptures out of large slabs of stone quarried in northern sweden. 

What figures then are monuments at once divorced and implicated. A touch of constancy inflected with a topological velleity.
